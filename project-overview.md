Minecraft Block Image Converter (Free & Open-Source)
Overview
Minecraft Block Image Converter is a free web-based tool that transforms any uploaded image into a grid of Minecraft blocks while preserving its original details. Using open-source image processing techniques and a color-matching algorithm, this tool maps every pixel to the closest Minecraft block, generating a visually accurate blocky version of the input image.

Key Features
✅ Upload Any Image – Users can upload photos, artwork, or game screenshots.
✅ Pixel-to-Block Matching – The tool replaces each pixel with a Minecraft block of the closest color.
✅ Adjustable Grid Size – Users can choose different levels of detail (e.g., 32x32, 64x64, or 128x128).
✅ Download Image Output – The processed image can be saved as a PNG file.
✅ Minecraft Build Export (Optional) – Users can download a .schematic file for use in Minecraft builds.
✅ Completely Free to Use & Build – No paid APIs, subscriptions, or proprietary tools required.

How It Works
Image Processing (Free & Open-Source)
Resize and preprocess the image using OpenCV & PIL (Python Imaging Library).
Color Matching Algorithm (Free & Lightweight)
Use a pre-built dataset of Minecraft blocks with average RGB values.
Compare each pixel’s color to the closest Minecraft block using k-means clustering or nearest neighbor search.
Block Grid Rendering (Fast & Efficient)
Convert the image into a structured grid of Minecraft blocks.
Render a preview in the browser using HTML5 Canvas.
Download & Export (Free File Generation)
Save the processed image as a PNG file.
Generate a .schematic file using an open-source Minecraft file generator.
